## About
I've always wanted to make games, but always encountered two main roadblocks:
Firstly, I usually enjoyed making the game **engine** more than I enjoyed
developing the actual game.
Secondly, I am not skilled in any of the artistic areas that are needed for a
game to be well received.

A simple roguelike avoids both these issues.

It is my goal to develop this project as long as I find it interesting.

## Instructions

First, get the code. Then build/run. Simple as that.

```
go get github.com/clagraff/pitch
go run main.go
```
