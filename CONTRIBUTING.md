# Contributing

Contributors are *always* welcomed on any of the projects I am in maintaining.

## Report an issue/feature!
1. Think of an idea to suggest, or find an existing bug to report.
2. Create a [new issue](https://github.com/clagraff/pitch/issues/new).
3. Engage in any discussion surrounding it.

Done! :thumbsup:
We appreciate any reported bugs or suggested features. It really does help!

## Create some code!
You can tackle:
* _any_ [open, unassigned issues](https://github.com/clagraff/pitch/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+no%3Aassignee)
* or [good first issues](https://github.com/clagraff/pitch/labels/good%20first%20issue)
* or issues that [require help](https://github.com/clagraff/pitch/labels/help%20wanted)

1. Find an issue to tackle.
2. Assign yourself to the issue if it is unassigned.
3. Fork the repo, and make some changes.
5. Create a pull request from your fork.
6. Someone will review it. Address any review comments.

Done! :clap:


## Code Style
Frankly, we are grateful of _any_ contributions. So we are pretty lenient on code style.

We'd _like it_ if you read through the [Go Code Review Comments](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments)
post. But if you _really_ don't to, we understand.

**At a minimum**:
1. Use `gofmt` / `goimports` on your code.
3. Document all exported functions & structs.
2. Add tests where it makes sense.
3. Keep current tests passing.
4. Passes any Pull Request integrations (if we any enabled).
